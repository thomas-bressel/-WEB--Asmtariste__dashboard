## 🎯 Project Vision

### The Passion
Born from a deep love for retro gaming, particularly Amstrad and Atari games that were originally developed in Z80 and 68000 assembly language during their golden era.

### The Observation
A striking comparison between two francophone communities:
- **Amstrad Community**: Very active with strong intergenerational knowledge transmission (50-100 annual productions)
- **Atari Community**: Passionate enthusiasts but lacking knowledge transmission mechanisms, resulting in scarce information and very few people willing to share their expertise

**The Mission**: Bridge this knowledge gap and preserve the invaluable expertise of Atari development before it's lost forever.
